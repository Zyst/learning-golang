# learning-golang
A repository where I drop code I create as I learn Go.

So far I went through the [Golang tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1), and [Go Koans](https://github.com/cdarwin/go-koans). Go Koans proved pretty enlightening in some subjects. I'd recommend it.

I'm currently working through [Build Web Applications with Golang](https://github.com/astaxie/build-web-application-with-golang/blob/master/en/03.4.md), it's proving very fun!

Then I'm going to do a practice project, which will probably be in another repository. And then I'll come back here and do "The Go Programming Language" book exercises in here.
